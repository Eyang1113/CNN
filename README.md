# Sports Equipment (balls) Classification using CNN
Project Description: This project focuses on developing a sports equipment classification system using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG11 model. The goal is to accurately classify images of five types of sports equipment: baseballs, basketballs, shuttlecocks, tennis balls, and volleyballs. The VGG11 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is fine-tuned to leverage its powerful feature extraction capabilities for this specific task. Images are preprocessed using techniques like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve the model's generalization. By freezing the early layers of VGG11 and retraining the final layers, the model adapts to the new dataset with fewer training resources. The classification performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which reveals the modelâ€™s ability to correctly predict most classes, with strong performance for basketballs and tennis balls. However, some confusion exists between similar classes, such as shuttlecocks and volleyballs. This project aims to improve classification accuracy through further fine-tuning and regularization, ultimately contributing to applications in sports equipment recognition. The use of transfer learning with VGG11 demonstrates the efficiency of pre-trained models in tackling real-world image classification tasks.
